1.)
A list of people from whom you have received help:

Soren Richenberg.

- He helped me debug my adjacentCells function, the one that returns a successor. I had a lot of trouble initially because I kept getting an out of range error because my edge cases were't correct. Showed me with the clion debugger where my errors were.


- He helped me with the the algorithm for finding the path. Gave me the idea that instead of modifying the one vector, I should modify another one. So the original vector is the matrix and the one I add the spaces to is the solvedMatrix, I initialized them both with the text file in the
constructor.

2.)
A list of people that you have helped:

 Chris Lapp: He had trouble reading in the input file. I just told him to go to run->edit configurations and make sure that he has a working directory and that the argument being passed is the txt file of the maze.

	
3.) 
 I didn't copy and paste lines of code from any website. I used the same logic in the ladder project.


4.) Function printMaze() is feature that is part of the project that I have chosen not to implement. I used this function when I was debugging Path function, because I wanted to track the path on the maze but it's unnecessary because the problem statement only wants the solved maze.
